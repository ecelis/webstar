## Testing

**TESTS WON'T RUN WITHOUT THE SELENIUM DRIVER AVAILABLE, SO SKIP TESTING**
Running tests will require installing the appropriate driver, which can be not as
easy as it sounds. So don't try testing if you don't know how to setup and install
selenium drivers.

The steps below are for Google Chrome `131.0.6778.204` on Ubuntu 24.10, adapt to
suit your system.

```
curl -LSO https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/131.0.6778.204/linux64/chrome-linux64.zip
unzip chrome-linux64.zip -d drivers/
cd webstar
PATH=../drivers/chrome-linux64:$PATH python manage.py test editor.tests
```
